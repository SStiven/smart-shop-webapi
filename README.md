# SmartShop Web API

The SmartShop web API is designed to help users find the best prices across different stores. Users can search for the best prices and identify store locations where items can be purchased at the best prices. Additionally, users can contribute price information to the platform. However, all users must be registered to access these features.

## Future Improvements

Future versions of the application will include features that allow users to keep their shopping list history.

## ToDos
- Create a pipeline including SonarQube for static code analysis.
- Move the appsettings information to a secret manager.
- Create a Terraform script for deploying on AWS/ECS.
- Implement a claim-based authorization system.

## Architecture

Consider using a vertical slice architecture instead of a horizontal slice architecture.
